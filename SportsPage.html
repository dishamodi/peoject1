        <p>Rohit Sharma scored a composed unbeaten century while Yuzvendra Chahal picked up four wickets as India got their Cricket World Cup campaign off to a winning<br>
		start at The Rose Bowl, Southampton on Wednesday on Wednesday. South Africa on the other hand, face an uphill battle after losing their third match in a row. <br><br>

          <b>Toss:</b> South Africa skipper Faf du Plessis won the toss and elected to bat against India in a World Cup match at the Rose Bowl on Wednesday.<br><br>

         <b>First innings:</b> South Africa decided to bat despite the overcast conditions but the decision backfired as Jasprit Bumrah (10-1-35-2) set the tone for the match with twin <br>
         blows in his opening spell. Leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal grabbed four wickets, helping India restrict South Africa to a sub-par 227/ 9 in their opening encounter of the<br>
		 World Cup.		<br><br>
