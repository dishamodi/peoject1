		<p>Irrespective of the political party or formation assuming power in New Delhi after the May 23 result, the biggest challenge for the new government would be<br>
		to generate adequate employment opportunities - to take care of about 12.8 million new entrants to the workforce every year and those migrating out of agriculture <br>
		to non-farm sectors (about 9 million people migrate for work annually).<br><br>

         Though no official data is available, the leaked report of the National Sample Survey Office's (NSSO) periodic labour force survey (PLFS) of 2017-18 showed that unemployment<br>
         rate has risen to a 45-year high of 6.1 per cent. The 2018 International Labour Organization (ILO) report, World Employment and Social Outlook Trends, shows that the number<br>
         of the unemployed is set to rise from 18.3 million in 2017 to 18.9 million by 2019.<br><br>

         All the poll surveys in the past couple of years have thrown up unemployment as the number one concern. Keeping such a large population in productive engagement is not only<br> 
         desirable for social harmony, but it is also essential to reduce poverty and inequality.<br><br>
